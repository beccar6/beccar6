# Hello, I'm Rebecca.
I'm a detail-oriented Data Engineering Specialist with a background in Information Technology and experience working with cloud platforms, data streaming, monitoring, and querying. I bring a solid foundation in managing and optimizing data infrastructure and enterprise indentities. I'm a quick learner, reliable team player, and an independant worker. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise and growing AI knowledge to contribute to innovative companies, especially in the healthcare, pharma, and sustainability sectors. I'm expanding my skill set into the field of AI & ML through practical projects that align with my passion for data-driven problem solving and sustainability. One project involved building a machine learning model to predict air quality levels in Copenhagen by combining public weather and pollution data. This project helped me apply foundational ML techniques while addressing an issue relevant to environmental health and sustainable urban living. I'm eager to relocate and bring my skills and motivation to a forward-thinking, diverse environment. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and volunteering in my community.
